# AI usage
Explain how you use the AI to solve the assignment. Put all ***your used queries*** in this section & what kind of AI are you using. Declare not using AI if you didn't do this.  

For this assignment, I used OpenAI’s ChatGPT Copilot as a supplementary tool to support my understanding.  It helped me clarify convex hull algorithms, explore Qt C++/Widgets examples, and organize the project structure with CMake. I adapted the generated insights into my own code while also referring to textbook materials.

# Collaboration usage
Explain how you are ***using others*** to complete the assignment in this section. Are they simply copying, learn the ideas, learn how to adapt the AI or anything involving the process. State the people if any & Please be elaborate. Declare self tought if you solved this by yourself. 

I solved this assignment by myself. I did not receive help or collaborate with others
